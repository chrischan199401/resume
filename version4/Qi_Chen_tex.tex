        \begin{itemize}
            \item Propose a utilization-based migration algorithm to migrate Virtual Machines(VMs) to stable hosts, which trades off Quality of Service (QoS) and power consumption.
	\item Evaluated that algorithm by Java simulations and the results reduced about 75\% migrations and saved up to 40\% power consumption compared with First Fit Decreasing 
\item \textbf{Publication:} \underline{\textbf{Qi Chen}}, Jianxin Chen, et al. "Utilization-based VM consolidation scheme for power efficiency in cloud data centers," in \emph{Communication Workshop (ICC), 2015 IEEE International Conference on}, pp.1928-1933, 8-12 June 2015APA (EI)

%                \begin{itemize}
%                    \item Used a unigram model to compute probabilities for possible answers to each clue from similar clues in a clue database
%                    \vspace{-1mm}
 %                   \item Used an iterative algorithm to fill in the crossword puzzle grid word by word.

%            \item Supervisor: Prof. Yong Yu
%            \item Collaborator: Kan Ren, Yiding Tian
%            \item Previous research to solve crossword only focused on clue-answer database or Wikipedia. We designed several secondary databases, such as synonym database and slang database. Then We integrated all databases in a multi-level system. According to the type of input clue, system would search different databases in a specific order, sequentially or parallelly.

%        \begin{itemize}
%            \item Supervisor: Prof. Yong Yu
%            \item I tried to find the relation between stock market indicators and investor sentiment hid in Guba. The project contained two parts. The first part was to analyze the sentiment from comments and posts in Guba. This part(Chinese sentiment analysis) was based on a Chinese lexicon and many semantic rules. Second part focuses on how to predict stock market indicators, especially close price, through the sentiment features.
%               % The solution was an ensemble of many models. According to specific purpose of the model, each model uses different features and data sets to train. To get a better result, there were 3 underlying algorithms using in models.
